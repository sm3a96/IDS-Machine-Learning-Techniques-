# Intrusion Detection System "IDS" Datasets and Machine Learning Techniques 

Primary Goal: Identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer networks.​
Targets insiders and external penetrators.​

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to identify unauthorized use, misuse, 
and abuse of computer networks. The focus is on detecting anomalous activities and security threats within the network environment.
